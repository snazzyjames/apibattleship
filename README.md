# API Battleship

API Battleship is a REST API for playing the strategy guessing game Battleship.

## Prerequisites

Golang is needed to build the executable: https://golang.org/doc/install

## How to Run the Application

Run `go build` from the project directory, which will generate an executable called `apibattleship`, which you can then run:

```bash
./apibattleship
```

## Troubleshooting

If for some reason the executable is unable to run, try deleting it and rerunning `go build` to generate a new executable.
