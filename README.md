# API Battleship

API Battleship is a REST API for playing the popular Milton Bradley game Battleship.

## How to Run the Application

Run `go build` from the project directory, which will generate an executable called `apibattleship`, which you can then run.

```bash
./apibattleship
```

## Troubleshooting

If for some reason the executable is not running on your machine properly, a new executable can be built by running `go build` from the project directory.  This will recreate the executable, which should then be able to run.
