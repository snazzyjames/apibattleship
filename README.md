# API Battleship

API Battleship is a REST API for playing the popular Milton Bradley game Battleship

## How to Run the Application

This project was built in Golang, so running the `apibattleship` executable should be enough to start the application:

```bash
./apibattleship
```

## Troubleshooting

If for some reason the executable is not running on your machine properly, a new executable can be built by running `go build` from the project directory.  This will recreate the executable, which should then be able to run.
